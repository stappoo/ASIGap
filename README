ASIGap provides a (Very Simplistic) wrapper around a portion of the ASIHTTPRequest library to enable PhoneGap posting of binary files from iPhone.

Thanks to Ben Copsey of All-Seeing Interactive (http://allseeing-i.com/ASIHTTPRequest/) for ASIHTTPRequest.
Thanks to Nitobi (http://nitobi.com/) for PhoneGap

Installation:

1 Start with a working PhoneGap installation in Xcode
2 Download the HTTPRequest tarball from (http://github.com/pokeb/asi-http-request/tarball/master)
3 Extract the HTTPRequest files into the Plugins directory
4 Configure HTTPRequest in your project per the documentation
5 cd to Plugins
6 clone ASIGap.git into ASIGap
7 Add ASIGap.h and ASIGap.m to your project (Right-click on Plugins -> Add -> Existing Files...)

You can now use Javascript such as below to submit a file and value for upload to a server.

PhoneGap.exec("ASIGap.submitForm", "http://myserver/upload_script", GetFunctionName(successCallback), 
	GetFunctionName(failureCallback), "AddPostValue", "ValueName", "data to post",
	"AddFile", "FileName", "path_to_file.ext");

Repeat "AddPostValue" and "AddFile" with two additional arguments each, as many times as 
necessary to post all of your data to the server.  

Define the success callback function to accept the response text from the server as an argument.

e.g.  function successCallback(response)
			{
				alert(response);
			}

Define the failure callback function to accept the errorCode (integer) and errorMessage(string) as arguments.

e.g.  function failureCallback(errorCode, errorMessage)
			{
				if (errorCode != 404)
				{
					alert(errorMessage);
				}
				else
				{
					alert('Nothing to see here, move along');
				}
			}


NOTE: Your server and upload_script must exist and must know what to do with the posted data.
NOTE: submitForm uses startSynchronous internally and does not respond until the net request 
completes.  BUT, the response information is not returned by submitForm.  You are required to 
define the success and failure callbacks in order to receive response data or error information.
